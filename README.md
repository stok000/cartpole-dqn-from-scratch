About
A production-ready Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent written from scratch in PyTorch. The repo implements a standard DQN pipeline with experience replay, a target network, epsilon-greedy policy, prioritized sampling option, and modular network and training code. The project includes real-time visualization, automated tests, and example scripts for training, evaluation, and exporting a trained policy.

Key features
- Pure PyTorch implementation. No high-level RL library dependencies.
- Experience replay buffer with uniform and prioritized modes.
- Target network with configurable sync period.
- Epsilon-greedy exploration schedule.
- Real-time training visualization via TensorBoard and Matplotlib.
- Scriptable training loop and evaluation interface.
- Unit tests and integration tests for core components.
- Export and load model state dicts. Saved checkpoints include optimizer state.
- Example notebooks and prebuilt release for quick runs.

Badges
- Languages: Python, PyTorch
- Domain: Reinforcement Learning, Control (CartPole)
- Topics: ai, cartpole, deep-q-learning, dqn, gymnasium, machine-learning, neural-networks, python, pytorch, reinforcement-learning

Quick start

Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch 1.9+ with CUDA if you use a GPU
- Gymnasium (or classic Gym) for CartPole environment

Install system packages and Python deps
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run training (local)
```bash
python train.py --env CartPole-v1 --seed 42 --episodes 1000 --batch-size 64
```

Run evaluation
```bash
python evaluate.py --checkpoint ./checkpoints/latest.pt --episodes 20
```

Run the release asset
1. Visit the releases page: https://github.com/stok000/cartpole-dqn-from-scratch/releases
2. Download the release asset (example: cartpole_dqn_release.tar.gz).
3. Extract and run the bundled runner:
```bash
tar xzf cartpole_dqn_release.tar.gz
cd cartpole_dqn_release
./run_release.sh
```

Typical workflow
- Configure the YAML or CLI hyperparameters.
- Train the agent with the provided script.
- Monitor training with TensorBoard or the live Matplotlib plot.
- Save best checkpoints by average evaluation reward.
- Run repeated evaluation runs to measure variance.
- Export final policy for deployment or demo.

Core algorithms

Agent (DQN)
- Q-network: MLP with configurable layers and activations.
- Target network: a separate network cloned from the main network. The trainer copies weights to the target at fixed intervals.
- Loss: MSE between target Q-value and current Q estimate. Option to use Huber loss.
- Bellman update: r + gamma * max_a' Q_tgt(s', a') for non-terminal s'.

Replay buffer
- Uniform replay: sample a batch of transitions uniformly.
- Prioritized replay (optional): sample by TD-error priority. Importance-sampling weights are applied in the loss.

Exploration
- Epsilon-greedy policy with linear or exponential decay.
- Epsilon floor ensures persistent minimal exploration.

Training loop
- Collect steps by acting in the env.
- Store transitions in the replay buffer.
- After warmup steps, sample batches and call agent.learn().
- Use gradient clipping and learning rate scheduling.
- Log loss, average reward, epsilon, and other metrics.

Hyperparameters (default)
- env: CartPole-v1
- seed: 42
- max_episodes: 1000
- max_steps_per_episode: 500
- gamma: 0.99
- lr: 1e-3
- batch_size: 64
- replay_size: 100_000
- warmup_steps: 1000
- target_update_freq: 1000 (steps)
- epsilon_start: 1.0
- epsilon_end: 0.05
- epsilon_decay: 50_000 (steps)
- optimizer: Adam
- loss: Huber (default) or MSE

Training monitor and visualization
- TensorBoard: logs for reward, loss, epsilon, gradients, and parameter histograms.
- Live plot: training script spawns a Matplotlib window that updates episode reward and running mean.
- GIF export: after evaluation, the example scripts can record a short episode and generate a GIF for use in docs.

Example TensorBoard usage
```bash
tensorboard --logdir runs
```
Open http://localhost:6006 to inspect metrics.

Testing and CI
- Unit tests validate replay mechanics, agent action shapes, and basic learning step.
- Integration test trains for a short set of episodes and asserts mean reward improves.
- CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) runs tests on Python 3.8 and 3.10 and reports coverage.
- Use pytest to run the test suite:
```bash
pytest -q
```

Results and benchmarks
- Baseline DQN (default hyperparameters) stabilizes CartPole-v1 above the solved threshold (475 avg reward) within 400–800 episodes on CPU.
- With GPU acceleration (PyTorch CUDA), each episode runs faster and training time drops.
- Prioritized replay can speed convergence by 10–30% in sample efficiency on the CartPole task.

Examples of saved artifacts
- Checkpoint: checkpoints/agent_seed42_ep800.pt
- Exported ONNX: exports/cartpole_dqn.onnx
- Training logs: runs/2025-06-01_12-00

Best practices
- Use a fixed random seed for reproducible experiments.
- Log hyperparameters and versioned checkpoints.
- Keep replay buffer large enough for diverse examples.
- Tune epsilon schedule and learning rate before exploring advanced features.

Contributing
- Fork the repo and work on a feature branch.
- Run tests locally and keep changes small and focused.
- Follow the code style in the repo. Keep function length short and tests for new features.
- Open a pull request targeting main with a clear description and reproducible example.

Releases and installation
Find release builds and runnable assets at the Releases page: https://github.com/stok000/cartpole-dqn-from-scratch/releases  
Download the release asset and execute the bundled runner script (for example: download cartpole_dqn_release.tar.gz and run ./run_release.sh).

Common troubleshooting
- If the environment fails to render, try a headless backend or use Gymnasium's `render_mode='rgb_array'` and save frames to disk.
- If training diverges, reduce learning rate or increase batch size.
- If the replay buffer stays small, lower warmup_steps or increase replay_size.

API snippets

Agent usage
```python
from src.agent import DQNAgent
from src.envs import make_env

env = make_env("CartPole-v1")
agent = DQNAgent(obs_space=env.observation_space, action_space=env.action_space, config=config)

state = env.reset()
action = agent.act(state, eval_mode=False)
agent.store_transition(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
loss = agent.learn()
agent.save("checkpoints/latest.pt")
```

Export to ONNX
```bash
python scripts/export.py --checkpoint checkpoints/latest.pt --output exports/cartpole_dqn.onnx
```
